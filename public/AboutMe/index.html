          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>My name is <b>Alina Bozynski</b>. I am currently 19 years old.</p>
          <p>
            I am half Polish, and half Filipino. My dad was born in Poland, and
            my mom was born in The Philippines. They both came to Winnipeg at a
            fairly young age and went to the same high school, where they met.

          <hr />
          <p>
            My brother and I both went to Holy Ghost School from Kindergarten to
            Grade 8. Then I moved to St. Mary's Academy for grades 9-12. As I'm
            writing this, I am currently attending Red River College, where I am
            working toward a diploma for Full Stack Web Development.

          />
          <p>
            This is my dad and I on vacation in Cuba. My mom always says that I
            am my father's daughter. We are very close and have very similar
            personalities. I take after him a lot, but I thank both my parents for
            all the qualities I have as a person.

          <p>
            This was my dog, Teddie. He was a Yorkshire Terrier and was VERY
            territorial, so he would bite whoever came over. Let's just say he
            wasn't trained very well... But nonetheless, he was my best friend
            and always knew when I was feeling down and would cheer me up. He
            had such a crazy personality that I will never forget. ðŸ’œ

          <p>
            This is my brother, Zack. We are 8 years apart. My parents decided
            last minute that my brother needed a sibling, so that is why our age
            gap is quite large. In fact, he is getting married this summer! He
            was supposed to get married last summer but postponed it because of
            COVID-19.

          <p>
            This is my brother's fiancÃ©e, Layne. We've grown very close since
            she asked me to be a bridesmaid. On our family trip to The
            Philippines in 2016, her and my brother convinced me that our hotel
            room was haunted! They always snuck in before I did and would move
            things around all weird for when we all came back together!

              I worked at Dairy Queen for almost four years, where my best
              friend's parents were my bosses. I could not have asked for a
              better or more fun work environment. The other workers were so
              kind, and the regular customers always came in to talk to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              There was a fire at work one day! Here is a picture from the
              security camera of the fire and I behind my boss. A bag under the
              heater had touched the top and caught on fire. It was soon a huge
              bright light! My co-worker started screaming, but I swiftly put it
              out. My bosses and I had a good laugh about the whole situation.
