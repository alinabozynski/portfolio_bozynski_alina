        <h2>Education</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After attending Holy Ghost school for K-Gr8, I went to St. Mary's
          Academy, in which I graduated from. I made many great friends here,
          including teachers, and created memories that I will never forget. I
          would do anything to go back and live those good ol' days again. It
          was not my choice to go to this high school, but I could not imagine
          how different my life would be had I gone to a different school, and
          made different friends. The friends I made at SMA are irreplaceable.
          They are good-hearted, funny, loyal, and always down for an adventure.
          I had the same "crew" I always went out during lunch with. As soon as
          the lunch bell rang, we would get to the car and always have the best
          hour ever. You don't need to know what we did at lunch, but it was
          always a blast and a half!

        <h2>What Am I Doing Now?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          As I'm writing this, I am currently attending Red River College, where
          I am working toward a diploma for Full Stack Web Development.

          Programming became a recent interest after graduating high school.
          Although I hadn't even tried anything like it before, the general
          concept of it really grabbed my attention. I liked how you could see
          different things affecting each other, and how there is math involved
          sometimes. I had not done anything computer related at all before, so
          I didn't know what to expect when getting into a program like this. It
          was an adjustment, for sure, especially when learning hardware and
          software in the first semester. But I think I made the right decision.
          I love it all so far, although it can be frustrating at times. Some
          times I will stare at an application for days and wonder why it won't
          work properly, and all it could be is a simple comma or a capital
          where there shouldn't be. You definitely need patience for this
          profession, but I think I have plenty to go around!

        <h2>Teachers</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I loved many of the teachers I had. Some of them called me by
          nicknames, "Boz" and "Bozzy". I will never forget Grade 9 Physics. He
          was one of the most fun teachers I've ever had, and was the first to
          call me by a nickname. He started calling me "Boz" because I always
          wrote "Alina Boz" on assignments, never writing out my whole last
          name.
        </p>
        <p>
          In class, he did lots of demonstrations and we had lots of fun
          experiments to do. He had a bunch of toys on his desk, which he threw
          at students who weren't paying attention. Now don't take that the
          wrong way, they were all soft and harmless things he was throwing and
          everyone got a kick out of it. It also helped that most of my friends
          were in that class that year. This made it even better. We had many
          funny moments with all the pets he had at the back of the classroom
          (which is where we sat). He had a bird, which we were allowed to let
          out once in a while. It flew around the classroom, traumatizing one of
          my friends that is terrified of birds. But she has a good sense of
          humour so it was all fun and games. She just hid under a desk while
          she screamed haha. One time, he even let me take care of his bird when
          he went away! He had geckos, too, which I loved to hold. They feel so
          cool! Speaking of cool, there was a huge fish tank by the front of the
          class. It was filled with lots of crazy looking fish. Sometimes, I
          would move to the front in the middle of class, both to visit with
          other friends, AND look at the fish :).
        </p>

          My Grade 11 and 12 Biology teacher was awesome as well. He called me
          "Bozzy" after hearing it around the school. He has a great sense of
          humour and everyone looked forward to his classes because they were
          just so fun and funny. His teaching style was great, and he made
          everything understandable for me. <i>FUN FACT:</i> I graduated with
          100 in Bio! The last two years of school I held my own "classes" at
          lunch for my friends so I could teach them chemistry and biology. It
          was fun to play a teacher role. My friends even let me call people up
          to the white board to get the full effect. There were a few people
          that I actually helped with their studies, and I'm so glad I could!

        <h2>Graduation</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Our graduation ceremony was held as a Drive-Inn (due to COVID-19) at
          the Assiniboine Downs Track. We had a grad dinner party at The Gates
          on Roblin (last picture below). The whole grade (we had 4 full-sized
          classes) could not be invited because of COVID-19 restrictions. This
          caused a lot of tension between the student that organized it and the
          students that were not invited. But there was nothing we could do
          about it, so she just had to try to apologize for the situation and
          help them understand that just not everyone could go.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friends and I went to go take pictures at the Cathedral. We spent
          the whole day taking pictures there, and at several other locations,
          and we went out for ice cream and food together after.
