            I have always been a creative kid. I have loved art and music since
            a young age, and that passion only continues to grow. I have played
            guitar since Grade 2, and have done art through my years in school.
            Music is always something I turn to. I <i>always</i> have music
            playing in my room. On a bad day, I come home, pick up my guitar,
            close my bedroom door, and just jam. I also write songs, whether I
            was in a great mood, or a bad one. My mood just controls what kind
            of song it is. I write the lyrics that portray what I am feeling. No
            matter if it is a happy or sad song, it turns feelings into
            something beautiful. After I write these songs, even if they are not
            complete, I feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders, as I
            leave any bad feelings in the song.

        <h2>Volleyball</h2>

          I have played volleyball copmetetively since Grade 4, when I joined
          the Grade 8 team. I also started to play club volleyball in Grade 7,
          which is held the season after school volleyball. I played beach
          volleyball as well, with my best friend as my partner. So, I was
          playing volleyball all 12 months of the year. I enjoy it a lot. Club
          volleyball had a very demanding schedule. This taught me to develop
          great time management skills at an early age, especially when I
          started working and had to balance school, work, and volleyball. I was
          always so busy, but I wouldn't trade that experience for the world. I
          have so many awesome memories from Club Nationals in different places
          around Canada. The venues we played in were just phenomenal! During
          our free time at Nationals, we explored the new place we were in, and
          swam in the hotel pool. Nationals was always during my dad's birthday
          so the team always had a party! I was also an assistant coach in 2021
          for Holy Ghost School's Tier 2 team. It was such a fun time teaching
          little kids everything I know, both about volleyball and team
          mentality!
